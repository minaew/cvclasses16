# Computer Vision Classes 2016

## Overview

This is a Computer Vision classes prepared for the 2nd-year M.D. students.
Course includes topics covering basic areas of computer vision. 
It takes 8 seminars-discussion lessons and 8 practical lessons.
Most practical lessons will be based on using of the OpenCV v3. library.
All materials and tasks will be hosted in this repository and available for all students. All program code is written under Visual Studio 2015 with v120 toolset.

## First Steps
Please ensure you have following instruments and settings to start the work:

* Visual Studio 2013 (2015 with v120 Platform Toolset)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [OpenCV v3.+](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
* [Image Watch plugin for VS](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e682d542-7ef3-402c-b857-bbfba714f78d)
* Camera to execute demo applications
* Setup Environment variable: OPENCV_DIR = C:\...\opencv\build\
* Put opencv_world300.dll into Release folder after first build and opencv_world300d.dll into Debug folder.

## Required Knowledge
* Basics of Digital Signal Processing
* Basics of Digital Image Processing
* C++ experience
* Git experience
